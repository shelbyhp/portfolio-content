    <p> Participatory design is positioned as an approach to address community challenges and reimagine potential futures by decentralizing systems of power and centering the marginalized, moving away from designers as experts and framing design as being community-driven. Methods of speculative participatory design are useful in imagining futures among marginalized groups while negotiating existing societal constructs. While research probes have been developed to support the practice of speculation in design, we have yet to see research probes in HCI that consider the lived experiences of Black and brown communities. In this pictorial, we illustrate the process of developing methods cards as design probes to encourage speculative and critical design thinking from an Afrofuturism lens. We highlight how Afrofuturism centers Black communities in design speculation lending to both equity-driven design outcomes, and an accessible resource that can be readily used by designers and non- designers alike in addressing community concerns. </p>
    <p> Afrofuturism offers a potential antidote to this thesis. Complementary to (and often lacking in) speculative and critical design approaches such as science fiction prototyping (which uses science fiction to speculate on technology and the future), Afrofuturism facilitates a more empathic design engagement that explicitly places the often disenfranchised black voice central in the design narrative, with an intent of universal betterment through and by technology.</p>
